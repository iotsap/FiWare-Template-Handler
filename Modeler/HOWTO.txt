1. Install a tomcat server (http://tomcat.apache.org)
2. Install Apache Ant if not done before
3. Copy the content of helpers_for_initial_build to platform/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/  [1]
4. Run the command "ant build-all-in-one-war" on the command line in the project folder
5. Open the generated target/modeler.war with 7-zip. A file system navigator will appear. Browse to the location where the file is placed and then under and double-click on it. Then double-click through the directory structure to WEB-INF/classes/configuration.properties.
6. Double-clicking the file will open a text editor.
7. Set for "fileSystemRootDirectory" an existing path on your system, e.g. "c:/repository". The created models will be saved in this directory.
8. Under Unix please make sure the user running the tomcat process has the permissions set to write in the folder
9. Set for "host" the host and port under which tomcat is reachable. It must be accessible from the outside, i.e. use the actual ip address within your network and not localhost.
10. Save the file in the editor and close the editor. A 7-zip message will appear asking whether the modifications should be applied to the orginal file, as shown below. Answer with ok.
11. Copy the generated signaviocore.war file to your tomcat webapps folder
12. Run <tomcat-folder>/bin/startup.bat (or startup.sh under Unix)
13. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/signaviocore/

The Signavio Explorer should now be displayed.

[1] The four files named platform/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/platform-extension-[...].jar are required for building the platform. They are generated during the build of platform extensions/bpmn20xmlbasic/. Unfortunately, building platform extensions depends on the build of the platform. To break this circular dependency, the jar files are placed in helpers_for_initial_build so they can be copied and used for the initial build. This is only appropriate as long as the source of platform extensions has not changed. Whenever platform extensions or the platform change, they have to be rebuilt manually to make the changes appear in the explorer. 

Once platform has compiled, this is possible via extensions/bpmn20xmlbasic/build.xml, default operation (ergo, just type ant).
