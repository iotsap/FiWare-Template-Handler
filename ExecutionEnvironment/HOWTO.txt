1.	Install a tomcat server (http://tomcat.apache.org)
2.	Go to the directory NGSI910DatastructuresAndNGSI10Operations
3.	On a command line, enter 'mvn install'
4.	Open ExecutionEnvironment/modules/activiti-webapp-explorer2/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF
	Write for "contextSubscriptionReferenceURL" the path where the deployment is accessible later, e.g. http://192.168.178.42:8080/activiti-explorer2/. It should be reachable from other participants, so do not use ‘localhost’ as host. The trailing slash is necessary.
	Set for ngsiServerURL the NGSI server’s deployment path, e.g. http://localhost:8080/NGSI10/. If you are not sure go again to http://localhost:8080/tomcat/manager/html and have a look in the appearing list.
5.	Go to modules/activiti-engine
6.	Enter 'mvn install -DskipTests'
7.	Go to modules/activiti-webapp-explorer2
8.	Enter 'mvn package -DskipTests'
9.	Copy the generated ExecutionEnvironment/modules/activiti-webapp-explorer2/target/activiti-webapp-explorer2-5.9.war file to your tomcat webapps folder
10.	Run <tomcat-folder>/bin/startup.bat (or startup.sh under Unix)
